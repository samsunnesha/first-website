		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p class="text">
			I am Samsunnesha Khatun, brought up in Murshidabad,a beautiful historical place.
			I am a Software Enginnering undergraduate Student in Hyderabad.I have always been a book lover, I love collecting books and read them.
			I believe books make our small world broder and help us live thousand lives. I remember, my first book was "Chander Pahar" a bengali adventure novel by one of great writer BIbhutibhushan Bandopadhyay when I was in my 7th grade.I remember I starded reading this book in the evening after studying then I couldn't stop reading, I spent that night reading this book.I remember tearing up so badly while reading as I was experiencing the life of Sankar, the main character of the novel, it was like I was living this adventurous life of Shankar. From then on I kept reading because I engoy reading different books. Earlier I read a lot bengali novels, now I read a lot about biographies and personal development books. Oprah Winfrey says,"Everything gets better when you share it." I strongly believe in that, And I am here to share my books and the summeries of what I learn from them and what you can learn too.
